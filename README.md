fngbot
======

I am a bot that tweets an object from the collection of the Finnish National Gallery: Ateneum, Kiasma and Sinebrychoff art museums.

Thanks to the Finnish National Gallery for releasing data on their 36 000+ artworks. 

To use, create an app on Twitter with write permissions and put the Twitter key and secret in a YAML file. Specify the art museum with the --unit argument, otherwise it'll pick a random artwork from the whole collection.
